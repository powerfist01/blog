### Hi!
My name is Sujeet Singh, I'm from India, I work at GreyB.

This is my log where I try to document my explorations across tech, finance, history, and life in general. Every week, I write about interesting things I worked on, things I read, movies I watched and so on. I have two major goals for this newsletter:

1. Create interesting content that helps me explain my perspective on things and is valuable to readers.

2. Improve my writing skills.

When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I'm probably listening to music, or solving puzzles, or playing chess.
